  <h3> Dialect Family Tree </h3>
  <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_Greek">Ionic dialect</a> was primarily used in Eastern Greece. It was originally spread from the Greek mainland across the Aegean around 11th century BCE and developed late in the 5th century BCE. It was adopted for use in Athens in 403 BCE. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ionic-dialect#ref170601">The Ionic dialect</a> forms a dialect group with the Attic dialect called Attic-Ionic. This became the basis of Koine, or common speech, which was the language of practically all later Greek writing, including the New Testament. By the middle of the 4th century BCE, it had become the common 24-letter Greek alphabet.</p>

  <h3> 
  <h3>Main <a href="https://academickids.com/encyclopedia/index.php/Ionic_language">Differences</a> of Ionic Dialect from Standard Ancient Greek or Attic: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> The Attic long alpha was turned into η in every position. </li>
  <li> Ionic lacked the initial aspiration from Attic. For example, instead of the Attic ἱπποσ (hippos), Ionic used ικκοσ (ikkos).</li>
  <li> Ionic Greek turned the un-Greek labiovelar sound in rather than in the front of back vowels. Oftentimes, a π sound was replaced with the κ sound. For example, instead of the Attic ὁπως, Ionic used οκως. </li>
  <li> Ionic contracts less often than Attic and retained the original Greek hiatus after the disappearance of some intervocalic consonants. For exmaple, Attic γενη was γενεα in Ionic. </li>
  <li> Ionic retained the double σσ like old Attic, which was later changed to ττ in Attic and changed back to σσ in Modern Greek. </li>
  <li> Ionic had a very analytical word-order, perhaps the most analytical one within the ancient Greek dialects. </li>
</ul>
  <h3> Versions of Ionic Dialect </h3>
  <p> There were two main subcategories of the <a href="http://www.aoidoi.org/articles/dialects.html">Ionic dialect</a> based on time period: Old Ionic and New Ionic. The transition between the two happened approximately around 600 BCE. </p>
  <h4> Old Ionic (Epic) </h4>
  <p> Old Ionic was based in the spoken language of the district in which the Iliad and Odyssey were composed by Homer. It was not the actual form of speech in common use in the region, but rather it was primarily the Ionic dialect interspersed with Aeolic and Mycenean elements and Atticisms. This version of the Ionic dialect was disseminated by rhapsodes, or public reciters, who chanted epics at public assemblies and festivals. This form of the Ionic dialect was later used by the Ionians and foreigners, such as Hesiod. It also became the basis of the works of Stesichorus, Pindar, and Herodotus. </p>
  <p> Here are some of the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0062%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DD%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Ddialects-harpers">differences</a> of Old Ionic from Koine (common Greek): </p>
  <ul>
  <li> The augment was used or disused at pleasure. </li>
  <li> Forms could be contracted or not. </li>
  <li> Diphthongs were shortened before succeeding vowels. </li>
  <li> The metrical value of vowels varied. </li>
  <li> Hiatus and elision were freely used. </li>
  <li> There was the existence of a spirant, sometimes with the letter j or a digamma. </li>
  </ul> 
  <h4> New Ionic </h4>
  <p> New Ionic was found in the writings of iambic elegiac poets, such as Archilochus, Callinus, and Memnermus, as well as in the prose of the pre-socratics, Herodotus and Hippocrates. It is also found in the iambic poetry of Archilochus, Anacreon, Semonides of Amorgos, and Hipponax of Ephesus. </p>
  <p> Here are some of the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0062%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DD%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Ddialects-harpers">differences</a> of New Ionic from Koine (common Greek): </p>
  <ul>
    <li> In interrogative and relative words, New Ionic retained the earlier κ for π. </li>
    <li> Simple vowels were interchanged with ει and ου. </li>
    <li> οη was contracted into ω. </li>
    <li> ηι was used for ει. </li>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crasis#:~:text=Crasis%20(%2F%CB%88kre%C9%AA,which%20it%20was%20first%20described.">Crasis </a>- two vowels of diphthongs merge into one new vowel or diphthong to make one word out of two</li>
    <li> Disuse of the appended ν. </li>
    <li> Use of αται when added directly to the tense stem. </li>
    <li> The genitive plural for Homeric άων was εων. </li>
  </ul>
